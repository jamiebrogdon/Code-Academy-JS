// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0


// forward counting
for (let counter = 0; counter < 4; counter++){
  console.log(counter);
}

// SOLUTION:
// set the iterator variable to the highest value in the initilization expression
// set the stopping condition to stop when the iterator var is less than 
// the iterator should decrease instead of increase after each iteration

// backward counting
for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--){
  console.log(counter);
}
